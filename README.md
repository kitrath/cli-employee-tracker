# CLI Employee Tracker

## Description
Provides a command-line interface to a simple employee database.  Users can view and create departments, roles, and employees.  Users are able to reassign employees to different roles.
The application is built with nodejs and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/). It uses [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for the command-line user interface, and [mysql2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2#readme) for interacting with the database.
